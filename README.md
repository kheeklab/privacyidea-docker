> If you like this project and find it useful, please consider starring :star: it on GitHub to help it reach more people and get more feedback.

## The image

The docker image is a self-contained Debian with privacyIDEA installed, which will run on every distribution.

> [!NOTE]
> **Disclaimer**: The respective trademarks mentioned in the offering are owned by the respective companies. We do not provide a commercial license for any of these products. This listing has an open-source license. privacyIDEA is run and maintained by NetKnights, which is a complete and separate project from Khalibre.

### Registry

The image is stored in bellow registries:

- [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/khalibre/privacyidea)
- [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Khalibre/privacyidea-docker/pkgs/container/privacyidea)

### Tags

The image tags are following privacyIDEA version e.g. `3.9.1` and `latest`. The default tag is `latest` is not suitable for production environments as it might not test all use cases.

| Tag | Description |

```console
make build
```

## Running

Run it with

```console

make run
```

Login to <http://localhost> with **admin/privacyidea**

> [!CAUTION]
> The default configuration provide in this reposotory contains fixed credentials and encryption keys for testing and demo purposes. It should not be used in a production environment.Please refer to the [configuration](#configuration) section below for more details.
>
> **Additional notes:**
>
> - Production environments should use environment variables or other secure methods to store sensitive information.
> - Fixed credentials and encryption keys can be easily compromised if exposed, leading to security breaches.
> - It is important to take all necessary precautions to protect sensitive data in production environments.

## Configuration

### Admin credentials

The Khalibre privacyIDEA container can create a default admin user by setting the following environment variables:

- `PI_ADMIN_USER`: Administrator default user. Default: **admin**.
- `PI_ADMIN_PASSWORD`:  Administrator default password. Default: **privacyidea**

## Providing Files to the Container

The privacyIDEA container uses the files you provide to execute the following use cases:

- Configure PrivacyIDEA with configuration files
- Run scripts

All of the use cases can be triggered on container creation when the container finds files in specific folders within key container folders.

### Key Container Folders

- /mnt/privacyidea
- /user/local/privacyidea/scripts

The Container Lifecycle and API specifies the scanned subfolders, the phases in which the container scans them, and the actions taken on their files.

You can provide files to the container in several ways.

### Ways to Provide Files

- [Bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
- [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/)
- [Using docker cp](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cp/)

All of the use cases require making files available on container creation. Bind mounts and volumes accomplish this. Applying config files can be accomplished on container creation using bind mounts and volumes, or at run time using docker cp.

Bind mounts are used in the examples here as they are simpler than volumes for providing files. As you prepare files for mounting to a container, it’s helpful to organize them in a way that’s easiest for you to manage. Bind mounting to privacyIDEA containers, organizing files, and using docker cp are covered here.

### Bind Mount Format

You can specify any number of bind mounts to a docker run command. Each bind mount follows this format:

```bash
-v [source path in host]:[destination path in container]
```

The bind mount source can be any folder path or file path in the host. The bind mount destination can be any folder path or file path in the container.

### Scanned Container Folders

The container scans these folders.

- /mnt/privacyidea/files (all files and subfolders are scanned)
- /mnt/privacyidea/scripts
- /usr/local/privacyidea/scripts/post-shutdown
- /usr/local/privacyidea/scripts/pre-configure
- /usr/local/privacyidea/scripts/pre-startup

## Container Lifecycle and API

At a high level, the container starts gunicorn with privacyIDEA deployed on it. Additionally, however, the container entry point provides an API for executing these use cases:

- Invoking scripts

The container provides an API for triggering and configuring these use cases. It executes the use cases in different phases of its lifecycle.

### Lifecycle

After you create a container in an environment, the container entry point executes the following lifecycle phases in that environment:

  1. Pre-configure: Runs user-provided scripts before configuring privacyIDEA.
  2. Configure: Prepares for running privacyIDEA.
      1. Set Python's runtime environment.
      2. Run user-provided scripts.
  3. Pre-startup: Runs user-provided scripts before starting privacyIDEA.
  4. PrivacyIDEA startup: Launches privacyIDEA.
  5. Post-shutdown: Runs user-provided scripts after privacyIDEA stops.

### API

The container entry point scans the following container folders for files and uses those files to configure the container and privacyIDEA and to act on privacyIDEA.

- /mnt/privacyidea
- /user/local/privacyidea/scripts

The key folders above have subfolders that are designated for specific actions. The subfolders, the actions taken on their files, and associated use cases are listed in lifecycle phase order in the following sections.
